# Snap!

Simulate a simplified game of "Snap!" between two computer players using N standard packs of 52 cards. 
The "Snap!" matching condition is on the face value of the card, the suit, or both. 

The program asks:
 * How many packs to use
 * Which of the three matching conditions to use

The cards are shuffled then played one at a time from the top of the common pile.
When two matching cards are played sequentially, a player is randomly chosen as having declared "Snap!" first and takes possession of all cards played in that round. 
The game continues until the pile is empty. 

The player who accumulated the most cards wins.
